[Wimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de) è un servizio che sostituisce l'ormai defunta Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. E' stato sviluppato da Wimm e Leseratte.

## Vari Patchers

There are lots of different methods to connect to Wiimmfi. Choose the one that fits your needs best.

### Automatic patching from the Disc Channel using Priiloader

#### Di cosa hai bisogno
- A Wii with Priiloader 0.9 or later installed

If you have an older version of Priiloader or don't have it installed, follow [this guide](priiloader) to update/install it.
{: .notice--info}

#### Istruzioni
1. Hold reset while powering on your Wii (if using a Wii mini, plug in a USB keyboard and press escape).
2. Go to `System Menu Hacks`.
3. Make sure the `Wiimmfi patch v2` hack is enabled.
4. Save settings and exit.

### Homebrew (Disc) Application
MrBean35000vr (creator of CTGP-R, a Mario Kart Wii content pack) created a Wiimmfi Disc Patcher that allows you to insert a disc and patch the game on-the-fly for Wiimmfi use, though this must be run every time you start the disc.

#### Di cosa hai bisogno
* Una scheda SD o chiavetta USB
* [Auto Wiimmfi Patcher](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/hbb/wiimmfipatcher/wiimmfipatcher.zip)

### No-Homebrew (Disc)
Thanks to Fullmetal5's str2hax exploit, which Leseratte was able to adapt for the Wiimmfi patcher, you can run the Wiimmfi patch without having any homebrew on your Wii.

#### Ciò di cui hai bisogno
* Una Wii con connessione Internet

#### Istruzioni

1. Inserisci il tuo disco.
2. Vai sulla tua connessione internet ed imposta il server DNS della tua console a 95.217.77.151.
3. Vai sulle informazione del contratto WC24 (terzo bottone dopo aver cliccato su "Internet" nelle impostazioni).
4. Conferma che vuoi usare WC24 e lo Shop Channel
5. La pagina del Wiimmfi patcher dovrebbe mostrarsi. Se non lo fa, e vedi ancora il normale accordo di licenza, il tuo router potrebbe non essere compatibile con questo metodo.
6. Aspetta circa 1 minuto e 30 secondi per caricare il patcher
7. Il gioco adesso dovrebbe avviarsi con la patch Wiimmfi inclusa

### Automatic patching using a USB Loader
If you are already using USB Loader GX, try updating it to the most recent version. Then, there should be a "private server" setting (both in the global loader options and in the game options) which you can set to "Wiimmfi" to make the USB Loader automatically patch every game you start to work with Wiimmfi.

### ISO Patching
You may not want to run a patcher each time you want to play on Wiimmfi, and maybe you already use a USB Loader. As such, ISO Patchers were created, some for specific games.

#### Ciò di cui hai bisogno
- Your copy of your game (WBFS, ISO, cISO, and other forms that a Wii can use are supported).
- [RiiConnect24 Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases/) (Solo per Windows)  
**oppure**
- Wiimm's ISO Patcher (cross platform)
   - [Patcher for Mario Kart Wii](http://download.wiimm.de/wiimmfi/patcher/mkw-wiimmfi-patcher-v6.zip)
   - [Patcher for all other games](http://download.wiimm.de/wiimmfi/patcher/wiimmfi-patcher-v4.7z)
- A USB Loader, [cIOS](cios), and a USB to store the game on (you should already have these if you're using a USB Loader)

#### Istruzioni
1. Estrai il patcher di tua scelta in una cartella, e mettici la tua copia del gioco.
2. Lancia il patch script per il tuo OS: solitamente finisce con `.bat` per Windows e `.sh` per Mac/Linux. Se stai usando RiiConnect24 Patcher, seleziona il tuo dispositivo (Wii, vWii o Dolphin) e scegli il patcher per il tuo gioco.
3. Once it's finished, get the version out of the `wiimmfi-images` folder (it may be in the folder outside of the patcher - ../wiimmfi-images) and copy it back to your USB.


#### Istruzioni

1. Extract Auto Wiimmfi Patcher and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD card or USB drive.
2. Insert your SD Card into your Wii, and launch Auto Wiimmfi Patcher from the Homebrew Channel.
3. Insert your game disc (you can insert it before or after launch, it doesn't matter).
4. Wait for patch to complete, and it'll begin!

### WiiWare Patching
You can patch WiiWare games in order to play them on Wiimmfi.

#### Ciò di cui hai bisogno

- Una SD card
- Your copy of your game (in WAD format)
- [RiiConnect24 Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-Patcher/releases/) (Solo per Windows)  
**oppure**
- [Auto WiiWare Patcher](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/auto-wiiware-patcher/releases) (cross platform)
- [Wii Mod Lite](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/hbb/WiiModLite/WiiModLite.zip)

[If you want to see how to use the WiiWare Patcher, click here!](wiiwarepatcher)
{: .notice--info}

Steps:
1. Extract the .zip of the latest version of Auto WiiWare Patcher, and put your WAD in it.
2. Lancia il patch script per il tuo OS: solitamente finisce con `.bat` per Windows e `.sh` per Mac/Linux. If you're using the RiiConnect24 Patcher, select your device (Wii, vWii, or Dolphin) and choose the WiiWare patcher.
3. If it completed successfully, install the WAD that was made in `wiiware-wads` with Wii Mod Lite.

## Altre cose

### Mario Kart Wii Competitions
Wiimmfi allows you to participate in Mario Kart Wii competitions again.

#### Ciò di cui hai bisogno

- Una scheda SD o chiavetta USB
- Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher
   - [Wii](https://hbb1.oscwii.org/hbb/competition-tool-wii/competition-tool-wii.zip)
   - [Wii U (vWii)](https://competitions.wiimmfi.de/competition-tool-wiiu.zip)

#### Instructions (for Wii)

1. Extract Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher and put it in the `apps` folder on your SD Card.
2. Insert your SD card or USB drive into the Wii.
3. Launch the original Mario Kart Wii game (not Wiimmfi patched).
4. Navigate to Settings -> Network Settings (or Nintendo WFC Connection) -> Message Service. If you turned the message service feature on, turn it off and turn it on again.
5. Launch Mario Kart Wii Competition Patcher.
6. The patcher will look for save files for Mario Kart Wii on your storage device in various places, and upload them. This is done in case a missing competition is found in your save file. It will also, of course, patch your Wii for competitions.

If you're using the Wii U, you will have to run the competitions patcher whenever you want to check for a competition, because WiiConnect24 is not enabled on the Wii U.

### DS Games
Wiimmfi doesn't only support Wii games, it supports lots of DS games too. Thanks to an exploit called nds-constraint, you can play DS games without patching your games.

#### Ciò di cui hai bisogno

- A Wi-Fi network with WEP or no security

Getting a Wi-Fi network with WEP or no security is the hardest part, because DS games don't support newer Wi-Fi security types (unless it's one of the few games that are "DSi Enhanced" and can use your Wi-Fi configuration on your DSi or 3DS, like Pokémon Black/White). However, many routers support creating a guest Wi-Fi connection, or you can make a hotspot on your phone or your computer. There are plenty of resources on the Internet that have information on this, so use your favorite search engine to find them.
{: .notice--info}

#### Istruzioni

1. Go in the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi settings. This can be accessed inside the game you want to play online with.
2. Set up a connection.
3. Scrivi `164.132.44.106` come DNS primario.
4. Type in `1.1.1.1` as the secondary DNS (if it gives you problems, try `8.8.8.8`).
5. Save your connection settings and perform a connection test. If it's successful, then you're ready to play.

### CTGP-R (Mario Kart Wii)
MrBean35000vr and Chadderz have an amazing CTGP-R distribution, the application that allows you to use a set of custom tracks, has automatic Wiimmfi patching. Go to the [ChadSoft Website](http://chadsoft.co.uk) for the download and instructions.

### MKW Hack Pack (Mario Kart Wii)
Huili has put together a really good collection of custom tracks and hacks called MKW Hack Pack, and allows connections to Wiimmfi. To learn how to set it up, go to the [wiki page](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/MKW_Hack_Pack).

### Wiimms MKW Fun (Mario Kart Wii)
Wiimm and Leseratte created a custom track distribution called "Wiimms MKW Fun", which gets updated about three times a year. It is based on the LE-CODE framework by Leseratte and contains a Wiimmfi patch and lots of other features. You can find out more about it on its [wiki page](http://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Wiimms_Mario_Kart_Fun).
