Para jogar múltiplos jogos, recomendamos que utilizes um disco externo com USB para a tua Wii. Nós iremos referir como "USB drive" neste guia. Maioria dos discos que encontras no mercado funcionam bem se tiverem compatibilidade com USB 2.0. Discos com 1 TB ou mais de armazenamento irão funcionar. A flash drive and SD Card will also work, but due to the size of a flash drive and SD Card, it won't be able to store as many games.

Unlike USB Loader GX, WiiFlow Lite can load games of an SD Card.

Make sure your USB drive and/or SD Card is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS. Não formates em outros tipos como extFS ou WBFS, o último é um formato antigo de armazenar jogos Wii.
